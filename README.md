Developed a custom compiler from the ground up, gaining hands-on experience with the full compilation pipeline, from lexical
analysis and parsing to semantic analysis, code optimization, and code generation. Our team designed and implemented each
compiler phase, carefully handling syntax and semantic checks, constructing abstract syntax trees, and optimizing code for
efficient performance.
